- Encrypt Message-
Use any of the sample messages or type your own message and encrypt it with Caesar or Vigenère schemas.
The first schema is a simple character shift. The second one, Vigenère, is more complex since each letter can be encrypted in more than one way. 
Each encryption scheme links to relevant information about how the encryption works, its history and how to use statistical analysis to break encryptions!

- Decrypt Message-
Send your messages to your friends or family and challenge them to decrypt your secret message. Or quickly solve cryptography puzzles. In case you are stuck, you can always break the cipher! 

- Break Encrypted Message -
Once you have broken the encrypted message you can view bar chart graphics of the decryption process.

Save encrypted or decrypted messages and open them later. You can also view, sort, delete and update all your saved messages.
